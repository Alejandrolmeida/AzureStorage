# **Deep Dive in Azure Storage**
In this project, libraries are collected to facilitate the use of the Azure Storage service, applying known cloud patterns and practices.

The Azure Storage service is commonly used as a highly scalable cloud repository, in high availability and with an SLA of the highest level. But this is not all when we are creating a more complete solution where this service is simply a piece of the complete solution.

In this repository we will find examples of .NET solutions that propose more complex cloud archetypes where we will learn how to take advantage of more advanced service capabilities to achieve higher performance and apply known patterns.
